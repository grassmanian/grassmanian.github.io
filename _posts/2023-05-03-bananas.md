A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several
kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
red, purple, or brown when ripe.

Despite all of this information, bananas are a vile and intensly unappetizing fruit, and ought not to be eaten under any circumstances. I would go so far as to suggest the only reason people eat bananas is because their peels facilitate easy transportation of the fruit, and unlike an orange, these peeels can be easily removed.
