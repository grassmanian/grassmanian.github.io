# About Me

I'd like to keep this site mostly anonymous. If you are in a position to Dox me, I kindly ask you to refrain from doing so. 

I have a lot of diverse interests, and not enough time to pursue any of them as well as I'd like. I knew Chinese (Mandarin) decently at some point in my life, but it's a rapidly atrophying skill. I became proficient in Latin recently, but fear it will go the way of Chinese. I sometimes unicycle, I sometimes play the viola, I pretend to read books, but read too many at once, making for very slow progress in all of them. 

I am interested in Cryptography and TEMPEST-style attacks on air-gapped systems, but no real experience with either. I enjoy the concept of policy reform, and have a few "great" suggestions that would make the world a better place, but chances are, I'm the only person that would enjoy them. (Global speed limit of 35 mph catch anyone's fancy?) I'm mildly interested in Finance, particularly imagining a financial system without usury. I'm also interested in predicting the future. If I know or believe something will happen in the future, and not everyone agrees, there should be an easy way to turn a profit from this. 

I'm also looking for a job. If you stumble across this site and are interested in hiring me, feel free to reach out. (Contact information not available at this time)

# About this site

Why does this site look the way it does? I suspect a lot of it boils down to 3 main observations:

 1. Tabbed web browsers are a questionable design choice
 2. Way less CSS/Javascript to worry about
 3. Hopefully I can self-host this in the future.
